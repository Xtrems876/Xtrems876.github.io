Hello.

My name is Adam.

I live in the Netherlands and I'm studying Business Intelligence. I was born in Kashubia - that's a region in northern Poland. That's also where I lived for most of my life and got my bachelor's degree in economics.

I have a little bit of experience with Python, JavaScript, and R. Worked on school projects as well as projects for a few companies. I'm dependent on Google, but I'm at a stage where I recognise and try to follow best practices when writing my code.

If you're wondering what I'm doing right now, I'm probably in front of a computer with a hot cup of tea.

I like FOSS, tea, anime, fantasy, indie games, etc.
