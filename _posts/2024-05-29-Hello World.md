# This is my first post using Jekyll

I don't know how any of this works, this will be a fun learning experience. I like that the site is static, I like that I can post on it by pushing markdown files to a github repo. I could use some cheatsheet aside from online guides, but that will probably quickly become obsolete.

## TODO

- correct social media links
- explore other things to correct
- improve metadata - the favicon, descriptions, etc...
- figure out how much I can do with this
- figure out how to put that mastodon thingy in this to make it green
